🎓 I'm a **telecommunications graduate** with a thing for building small and simple tools that solve daily problems.  
🔧 Currently trying to expand my skills by learning modern tech stacks, building things that **work** (and trying not to break them immediately after).  
💼 I'm open to work! Looking for an **entry-level developer** role to kickstart my journey.
